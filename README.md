# WSESData

This Python script is designed for data visualization and analysis, particularly focusing on sales data. It includes multiple sections, each serving a specific purpose:

Reading Data: The script starts by importing necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, squarify, and seaborn). It then reads data from an Excel file, specifically from the sheet named 'Sheet1'.
Sales Outcome Analysis: It calculates the count of sales opportunities based on their outcomes (e.g., successful, unsuccessful) and visualizes this distribution using a pie chart. The chart includes percentage labels, an exploded segment for emphasis, and a shadow for aesthetic enhancement.
Opportunities by Reporting Status: The script calculates the count of opportunities by their reporting status and plots this data in a bar chart. This visualization helps in understanding the distribution of opportunities across different reporting statuses.
Regional Distribution of Opportunities: Another bar chart is plotted to show the number of opportunities across different regions, providing insights into geographical trends in sales opportunities.
Profit Percentage Distribution: A box plot is used to visualize the distribution of profit percentages, offering a clear view of the range, median, and outliers in the profit data.
Sales Value and Profit Correlation: To explore the relationship between sales value and profit, a scatter plot is created. This visualization is crucial for understanding how these two metrics are correlated.
Industry Analysis: The script calculates the mean relative strength in the segment for each industry and represents it in a horizontal bar chart. This analysis is vital for understanding the position of different industries in the market.
Product Profit Analysis: Finally, the script calculates and plots the mean profit for each product in a bar chart, allowing for a comparative analysis of profitability across different products.
Each section of the script is accompanied by appropriate titles and axis labels for the charts, ensuring the visualizations are informative and easy to understand. This script is ideal for anyone looking to perform a comprehensive analysis of sales data with a focus on visual storytelling
